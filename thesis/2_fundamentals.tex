\subsection{Basic definitions in graph theory}
Before we start with the proofs of algorithm, let's give some useful definitions in graph theory:

\begin{definition}
A \textit{cycle $C$} in $G$ is a simple path $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$, where $v_n = v_1$. In the \textbf{Figure 1}, $v_1v_2v_3v_4$ is a cycle.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
When a connected graph can be drawn without any edges crossing, it is called \textit{planar}. When a planar graph is drawn in this way, it divides the plane into regions called \textit{faces}. \cite{Discrete_Mathematics} In \textbf{Figure 2}, $v_2v_3v_4v_5$ bounds a face.

\end{figure}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A cycle $F$ is a \textit{facial cycle} in $G$ if it bounds a face in a component in $G$(possibly the outer face), regardless of whether $F$ itself is a face or not. \cite{dvorak2013threecoloring} Both cycles in \textbf{Figure 3} are facial cycle.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A cycle $C$ in a connected graph $G$ is a \textit{separating cycle} if the deletion of $C$ from $G$ results in a disconnected graph. \cite{THOMASSEN197857} In the \textbf{Figure 4}, $v_1v_2v_3v_4$ is a separating cycle, because inside this cycle there are two more vertices $v_6, v_7$.

\end{definition}

\begin{observation}
In a drawing of a graph, a cycle is either a facial face or a separating cycle.
\end{observation}

\begin{definition}
A vertex $v$ is \textit{incident} with an edge $e$ if $v \in e$; then $e$ is an edge at $v$. The two vertices incident with an edge are its endvertices or ends, and an edge joins its ends. \cite{diestel2010graph}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
In the plane, a face $f$ is \textit{the outer face}, if all vertices are contained inside in this face. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \textit{open disk} is a cycle and everything inside it in a drawing of graph but not vertices on the bound. A \textit{closed disk} is a cycle and everything inside it in a drawing of graph including vertices on the bound.

\end{figure}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
We say that $P = v_1v_2v_3...v_k$ is an \textit{induced path} in $G$ if $\forall v_iv_j \in E$ $\Longleftrightarrow$ $|i - j| = 1$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{The core idea}
After knowing these beneficial definitions, we will introduce five reducible configurations, also called \textit{multigrams}. With such multigrams, we can reduce the size of graph $G$ to have a smaller graph $G^{'}$ by identifying some vertices (see definition in the next section). Meanwhile, although we get a smaller graph $G^{'}$, its coloring can be reconstructed to the coloring of $G$ in constant time. The algorithm detects recursively such multigrams with certain constraints so that the size of graph will always get smaller each time until it's so simple to find the corresponding coloring. Next, according to the resulted coloring, we can reconstruct the coloring of its previous graph step by step. In the end, we'll get the proper coloring of the input graph. \footnote{Demonstration of the algorithm can be found in appendix}
