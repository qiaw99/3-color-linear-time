The algorithm may be viewed as an iterative version of a method originally proposed by Auslander and Parter and correctly formulated by Goldstein. The algorithm used depth-first search and has O(V) time and space bounds, where V is the number of vertices in G. An ALGOL implementation of the algorithm succesfully tested graphs with as many as 900 vertices in less than 12 seconds.},

abstract = {Three edges e1, e2 and e3 in a graph G are consecutive if they form a path (in this order) or a cycle of length 3. The 3-consecutive edge coloring number ψ3c′(G) of G is the maximum number of colors permitted in a coloring of the edges of G such that if e1, e2 and e3 are consecutive edges in G, then e1 or e3 receives the color of e2. Here we initiate the study of ψ3c′(G). A close relation between 3-consecutive edge colorings and a certain kind of vertex cut is pointed out, and general bounds on ψ3c′ are given in terms of other graph invariants. Algorithmically, the distinction between ψ3c′=1 and ψ3c′=2 is proved to be intractable, while efficient algorithms are designed for some particular graph classes.}

abstract="The evaluation or fitness function is a key component of any heuristic search algorithm. This paper introduces a new evaluation function for the well-known graph K-coloring problem. This function takes into account not only the number of conflicting vertices, but also inherent information related to the structure of the graph. To assess the effectiveness of this new evaluation function, we carry out a number of experiments using a set of DIMACS benchmark graphs. Based on statistic data obtained with a parameter free steepest descent, we show an improvement of the new evaluation function over the classical one.",
